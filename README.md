# Fog Computing for Resource-Constrained IoT Devices

## Overview

This research project explores the potential of fog computing to enhance the performance of resource-constrained IoT devices. Fog computing extends cloud computing capabilities closer to the edge of the network, providing real-time data processing and analysis, storage, and retrieval services. By offloading these tasks from IoT devices to fog nodes, we can significantly reduce latency, improve throughput, and enhance energy efficiency.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

1. Develop a lightweight and efficient fog computing framework that seamlessly integrates with existing IoT systems.

2. Design and implement a scalable fog node architecture that supports a variety of hardware configurations, including edge devices, gateways, and cloud servers.

3. Conduct comprehensive performance evaluations of the fog computing framework in real-world scenarios, focusing on latency, throughput, and energy efficiency.

4. Demonstrate the potential of fog computing to revolutionize IoT device deployment and management practices, enabling more responsive, efficient, and secure IoT applications.

## Expected Outcomes

The successful completion of this project is anticipated to yield the following outcomes:

1. A robust and scalable fog computing framework that can be readily adopted by IoT developers and practitioners.

2. A comprehensive understanding of the performance and energy efficiency benefits of fog computing for IoT applications.

3. A set of guidelines and best practices for deploying and managing fog-based IoT systems.

4. A foundation for further research and innovation in the field of fog computing for IoT.
